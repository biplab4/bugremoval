AI-Powered Bug Fixer (BugRemoval)<br/>
 This project is an automated AI bug-fixing tool that:<br/>
  âœ… Scans Python code for linting errors and bugs.<br/>
  âœ… Uses AI (GPT-4) to suggest fixes for detected issues.<br/>
  âœ… Commits and pushes the fixes to GitHub daily.<br/>

ðŸŒŸ How It Works<br/>
  Linting: The tool runs flake8, a Python linter, to detect errors in your repository.<br/>
  AI Bug Fixing: If issues are found, GPT-4 suggests fixes based on the lint_report.txt file.<br/>
  Auto-Commit: The fixed code is committed and pushed to GitHub using GitHub Actions.<br/>
  Runs Daily: The process repeats automatically every day via GitHub Actions.<br/><br/>
  
ðŸŽ¯ Why Is This Useful?<br/>
  âœ… Keeps Your Code Clean â€“ Fixes linting issues automatically.<br/>
  âœ… Automates Code Reviews â€“ AI suggests fixes for common mistakes.<br/>
  âœ… Daily Improvements â€“ Your repository gets better over time without manual effort.<br/>
