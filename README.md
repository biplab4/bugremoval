🛠 Project: AI-Powered Bug Fixer (BugRemoval)
📌 What This Project Does
This project is an automated AI bug-fixing tool that:
✅ Scans Python code for linting errors and bugs.
✅ Uses AI (GPT-4) to suggest fixes for detected issues.
✅ Commits and pushes the fixes to GitHub daily.

🌟 How It Works
Linting: The tool runs flake8, a Python linter, to detect errors in your repository.
AI Bug Fixing: If issues are found, GPT-4 suggests fixes based on the lint_report.txt file.
Auto-Commit: The fixed code is committed and pushed to GitHub using GitHub Actions.
Runs Daily: The process repeats automatically every day via GitHub Actions.
